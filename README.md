# ImageBucket

This is an early experiment in using Meteor with React, as part of Stephen Grider's course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/meteor-react-tutorial).

The app uses the Imgur API to source images, and Bootstrap for CSS styling.

To get the app up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd ImageBucket
2) npm install
3) meteor
